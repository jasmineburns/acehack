A proud sophomore at the Indian <i>Institute of Technology Kanpur</i>, majoring in <i>Computer Science and Engineering</i>.<br><br>
Currently a <i>summer research intern</i> at the <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org">Max Planck Insitute for Software Systems</a>, working with <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~eva/">Prof. Eva Darulov√°</a>

Throw in ramblings about Linux, Vim, Web Development, and some occassional philosophy; that's about much regarding this blog.<br>

This happens to be the <i>fourth complete rewrite of my homepage</i>. And I'm not stopping.
<br><br>
As for about me, that's on the <a href="./about.html">About me</a> page.

Some things I'm passionate about (happen to be mostly computing related <i>somehow</i>):
<ul>
  <li> Linux (Gentoo and Arch)</li>
  <li> Text editors (Shifted to Emacs, still in love with Vim)</li>
  <li> Cyber security (Hacking ^_^ Not really..)</li>
  <li> Functional Programming (love!)</li>
  <li> Open Source </li>
  <li> Web Development</li>
  <li> Tiling Window Managers (XMonad and i3wm)</li>
  <li> Rambling? (sometimes phrased as 'writing')</li>
</ul>
