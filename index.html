A proud Undergrad at the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, majoring in <i>Computer Science and Engineering</i>.<br>
I was a <i>summer research intern</i> at the <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org" target="_blank">Max Planck Insitute for Software Systems</a> during Summer '16, having worked with <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~eva/" target="_blank">Prof. Eva Darulov√°</a> in the Automated Approximation and Verification group.<br><br>

Throw in ramblings about Networks, Linux, Vim, Web Development, and some occassional philosophy; that's about much regarding this blog.<br>

This happens to be the <i>fourth complete rewrite of my homepage</i>. And I'm not stopping.
<br><br>
As for about me, that's on the <a href="./about.html">About me</a> page.

Some things I'm passionate about (happen to be mostly computing related <i>somehow</i>):
<ul>
  <li> Computer Networks (New and current favorite)</li>
  <li> Linux (Gentoo FTW!)</li>
  <li> System security (Hacking ^_^ Not really..)</li>
  <li> Text editors (Emacser, can still switch to Vim easily)</li>
  <li> Functional Programming (love!)</li>
  <li> Open Source (check out <a href="https://github.com/sakshamsharma" target="_blank">my Github</a>!)</li>
  <li> Web Development</li>
  <li> Tiling Window Managers (XMonad and i3wm)</li>
  <li> Rambling? (sometimes phrased as 'writing')</li>
</ul>
